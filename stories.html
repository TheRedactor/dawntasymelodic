            <h3>His Promise (S1B1)</h3>
            <p>The world of Dawntasy is governed by a tyrannous, nefarious organization known only as LTR. When all hell breaks loose, the Time Rebellion League is formed with only one obligation, taking down the organization and its devious leader, while Yaya the bearman struggles to find peace within himself after his beloved master is slain by enemy forces. However, he begins to realize that all is not lost, and that backing down was the worst thing he could have done.</p>

            <p>His brother is gone, the necklace is gone and his home is going to be gone if he doesn't act fast. Questa knows that time is short, luck is not on his side and that fate is playing its cards cruelly on him. He had promised that he would see his brother again, even if it meant going through unbearable hardship and turmoil, but he hadn't seen reconciliation in a whole decade. With his life in pieces, Questa embarks on the quest of his lifetime to find his long-lost brother, while escaping the clutches of the nefarious Time Smith. </p>
