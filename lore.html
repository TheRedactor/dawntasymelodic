        <h2 class="bounce-in">The Circular Dawn Concept</h2>
        <p class="slide-up">The World of the Dreamscape is constantly in motion. It is ruled by a single law, the Circular Dawn. This concept suggests that "time is circular", which is yet to be explained by the adventurers of DSR. The Circular Dawn is comprised of two main polar energies, which influence the world we live in. These two energies are known as Eternality and Ephemerality, and define the concept of time. In the Dreamscape, Ephemerality, with its physical definition/representation known as the Realm of Dawnstoria (Dawnstory), can be explained by "negative time" or being too short for time to exist. Eternality, or physically represented as The Rift, can be explained by "positive time", in a way in which the mere lengthiness of the Circular Dawn in this concept would be too long for time to exist. The middle of them both is known as the Fall (or Fall Point), though with no explicit name, is deemed the most optimal for life to be maintained. However, the Fall can only be maintained if Dawnstory and Rift are at equal power. If this stability is suddenly broken, all hell will break loose and the world will be in shambles as time will bend. Luckily, there exists a primordial being known as ADE (Astral Dream Essence), who ensures that the Dreamscape is at its balance at all times. But they say even the goodest people have their darkest sides. So does ADE. And thus, CSE (Chaos Shadow Essence) was born, the darker alter ego of Astral Dream. Twelve powerful beings of celestial might known as the Tempests, now seen as the constellations in the night sky, fought CSE, but were defeated, and thus, ADE knew that he had to take this Gordian knot into his own hands. As a result, ADE banished CSE to the Rift Realm, a neverending torture for the supereons to come. But they say that on the Twelfth Night of the Purple Moon, the Rift shall open. The inhabitants of Dawnstory are unbeknownst of this impending threat, and with a "malicious" dictator clutching their cities with a draconian grasp, they are not yet prepared for the threat bigger than anything they've ever experienced.</p>

        <h2 class="bounce-in">The Ancient Stone Principles</h2>
        <p class="slide-up">The principle that comes with the Circular Dawn is the Harmony. It is believed that opposites attract, and that all polarities coalesce to form harmony; for instance, without sun and moon there would be none of the day-night cycle. Without winter, summer, spring and autumn, there would be no diversity for life to thrive. This is a vital law that everyone in DSR must abide by.</p>

        <h2 class="bounce-in">The Constellation Gates</h2>
        <p class="slide-up">Each realm has 4 Constellation Gates, which align with the Dawntasy Constellations. The realm of Dawnstory has 4 Rift Gates: Oamai Minor Gate, Benevegean Minor Gate, Refe Minor Gate and one unfound Major Gate. The realm of Fall has another 4: Phoenaenon Major Gate, Filapawa Minor Gate, Lyrarin Minor Gate and Jifis Minor Gate. Lastly, the Rift Realm has the last 4: Gea Major Gate, Majoris Major Gate, Fadia Major Gate and a mysterious gate.</p>

        <h2 class="bounce-in">The Fall River</h2>
        <p class="slide-up">The Fall River is a river filled with stars that divides the two realms apart. It is imbued with the power of stars and is blessed by the power of the celestials. It is revered for its mysterious nature and the fact that it encompasses all 6 elements of Fall to unite with infinite power.</p>

        <h2 class="bounce-in">The Conglomeration Era</h2>
        <p class="slide-up">During the era known as the Conglomeration, or the bridge between Eternality and Ephemerality, the universe…could be considered an optical illusion, a dream, the very fakeness of the fabric of reality. The representation was known as A, or Astral Dream, as the name was “too transcendental to be pronounced by a mortal tongue”. During Aequinoctium, or the Conglomeration, the Dreams obtained physical representations, thus sustaining life and creating the universe. There were twelve key principles of the Dream, which was the very middle of Eternality and Ephemerality. To secure the balance of the Dream, there were Constellations that adhered to the principles and yet were bound by them as a limit to chaos and destruction, with each respective EAE Title resonating with its respective principle. A representation of the former B.A Age would, for instance, differ from the current Dawnstory Age representation. But there was a darker force too. Divinity laws of the universe state that a Primordial Dream would be bound by immortality for the eternally relentless time of reality, yet mortals would be bound by mortality for the ephemeral time of their existence.</p>

        <h2 class="bounce-in">The Tempests and Chaos Shadow</h2>
        <p class="slide-up">Then came the images of the Dream, or the Tempestuous Constellations, who reflected each respective principle. Aries, Taurus, Libra, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Sagittarius, Aquarius, Pisces, Capricorn, Virgo, Scorpio, each a constellation representation of the Dream Definitions. Judging fate, the Constellations commanded the natural influences of the universe and decided the verdict for the many vices or the many moral deeds that mortals committed. When half of the Gaze Dreamscape fragment was split, it formed into Chaos Shadow, the alter ego of the life-sustaining AD. Of course, it did not end up well, with Shadow becoming corrupted, plaguing himself with enmity and vengeance. The Fall Point, or the Horizon, was the border between each of the abstract EAE intervals of the Dream, as well as life and death. As avarice and evil burned the heart of Chaos Shadow, the former Constellation wreaked havoc onto the lands for millennia. At last, the other Constellations were ordered to take down Chaos Shadow. However, the Tempestuous Constellations were no match for Chaos Shadow Dream, with the laws of divinity acting as a buff to his physical strength and a shield against the Constellations’ powerful blows. Eight of the Constellations ended up crossing the Horizon, with only three left, namely: Filapawa Revelate of Libra, Lyrarin Pyro of Scorpio and Norsty Tabla (aka Time Smith) of Aries.</p>

        <h2 class="bounce-in">The Elements</h2>
        <p class="slide-up">The elements are fundamental forces in the world of Dawnstory. Each element has its unique properties and influences the world in various ways. The six main elements are Fire, Water, Earth, Storm, Ice, and Zephyr. These elements are embodied by the Tempests, celestial beings who maintain the balance of the world.</p>
