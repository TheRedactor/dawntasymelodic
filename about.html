        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an inspired young kid with the hopes of publishing my book series, Dawntasy: Dawnstory Revelation, in the future when I am an adult. My journey delving into the Dawntasy Saga began ever since I was 6, and with a keen and imaginative mind I would often drift off into my own worlds where anything was possible and adventures spark from everywhere. 5 years into the series, various iterations have been made since its commencement to hone in on the saga and refine any parts that required further development on. Thank you to everyone who has supported me on this journey; I wouldn't have made it this far without everyone!</p>
   <main>


    <h2>Characters and World-building</h2>
    <p>At the heart of Dawntasy are its characters and world-building. From the brave Questa to the mysterious Solus, I make sure each character brings their own unique story and perspective to the saga. The world of Wintro is filled with excitement, creating a rich tapestry for readers to explore.</p>

    <h2>Mission and Vision</h2>
    <p>My mission with the Dawntasy saga is to spark interest and spread joy and ecstasy within such a technology reliant world. I believe that stories have the power to move hearts and change the way people feel, and I hope that Dawnstory will resonate with readers on a deep and meaningful level.</p>
