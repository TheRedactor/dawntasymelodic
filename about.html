        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an inspired young kid with the hopes of publishing my book series, Dawnstory Revelation, in the future when I am an adult. My journey delving into the Dawnstory Revelation Saga began ever since I was 6, and with a keen and imaginative mind I would often drift off into my own worlds where anything was possible and adventures spark from everywhere. 5 years into the series, various iterations have been made since its commencement to hone in on the saga and refine any parts that required further development on. Thank you to everyone who has supported me on this journey; I wouldn't have made it this far without everyone!</p>

    <h2>Characters and World-building</h2>

    <h2>Mission and Vision</h2>
    <p>My mission with the Dawnstory saga is to spark interest and spread joy and ecstasy within such a technology reliant world.

    <p>Dawnstoria bling tes a bromage pemm balea lite fadia, benevegean adver brust sinc mae gloam, preste res tabla questa bpte. Besti mayes!</p>
    <p>The reality we live in is unreal, unfair and ambivalent, but at the end of the day, bravery and commitment is what makes reality real, fair and just.</p>
