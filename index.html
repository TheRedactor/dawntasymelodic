          <h2>A sneak peek into the first book...</h2>
      <p>Yaya stood at the edge of Unknown Town, a sense of foreboding washing over him as he gazed upon the desolate town before him. Unknown Town was further than Yaya had ever ventured. The moon cast an eerie glow over the abandoned streets and at once Yaya regretted coming on this mission; he wished he had just stayed home. 
He had once dwelled in Bear Village, a Utopia that he would never forget. He had been one of the village’s most honourable warriors, but ever since the delinquents had come to Bear Village, plundered everything and took everyone he loved, he knew that he had to fight not just for the legacy of Bear Village, but also for the world. But that was when his epic journey commenced. After he had been banished out of town by the Bear Chief for ‘letting them down’, he had encountered numerous perils which had extended his combat capabilities to a grade in which he was selected into the Time Rebellion League, a group of fearless rebels devoted to taking down the evils of the world, abolishing totalitarian rule and liberate the land of Isllandio off the clutches of the notorious tyrant known as Time Smith. Only a few months ago did Time Smith place his draconian laws in place, and it didn’t take long for a single brave mutineer known as Blokk to hold a rebellion against him. Blokk had called it the “Time Rebellion League”, “TRL” for short. He had set up their ‘secret hideout’ on a small sequestered outpost they called Sepdet Outpost, a few miles from Unknown Town. Blokk knew that just himself wasn’t enough to liberate Isllandio. He needed an army of people who all fought for the same obligation. And so Yaya joined with the hope of achieving redemption within his Bear community and being recognised as a saviour to Isllandio. Yaya also knew of Captain Salvapige, a legendary hero who had died before his grandmother’s eyes, who had written a recount and died seconds after. He had died for his own city, Doenoughts. For a split second Yaya felt like Salvapige, who had always been a menace to ruffians. But the thought of Time Smith made him step back once more. He had gained a reputation of never failing a task, but this was different. This was Time Smith he was facing. He felt a knot of apprehension tightening in his chest as he contemplated the mission that lay ahead. It proved to be a daunting challenge, but Yaya knew that the fate of his people depended on his success. He had been given a chance to prove his worth, and this was it. He couldn’t give up right now.
With a deep breath, Yaya pushed aside his doubts and stepped forward into the darkness. As he ventured deeper into Unknown Town, Yaya picked up the odour of corpses; this was a place where safety was not guaranteed, at all. Around him, dilapidated buildings crumbled and the reflections were a menace. The once vibrant city had been reduced to a ghostly shell of its former self, a testament to the cruelty of Time Smith's rule. Time Smith had taken everything from him, and though he had never caught a glimpse of this notorious tyrant, he knew that everything, EVERYTHING was Time Smith’s fault.  With renewed determination, Yaya trudged on, his heart set ablaze with the fire of justice. 
"Stop right there!" A voice shattered the silence, slicing through Yaya's thoughts like a blade. He turned slowly, paralyzed by fear, to face the source of the command.
Before him stood a figure cloaked in army attire, bearing the scars of countless battles etched into his weathered face. His muscles bulged beneath the fabric, and his eyes gleamed with a warlike intensity that made Yaya's spine quake with anxiety. In his hand, he held a sharp spear, its tip aimed directly at Yaya's heart.
"What... what are you doing?" Yaya's voice trembled as he struggled to form the words.
"Putting you under arrest," the man growled, snarling menacingly. 
"But I'm allergic to manacles," Yaya blurted out, his mind racing to find a way out of the predicament.
"Are you?" The man's tone was dismissive as he raised his spear until it was touching Yaya’s throat. Yaya felt the manacles tighten.
"Yes. Last time I was near them, I almost got anaphylaxis. Take it off please," Yaya insisted, grasping at any excuse to evade capture.
Despite Yaya's protestations, the man moved forward, his grip tightening on the spear. With one swift stroke, he leapt at Yaya and before Yaya figured out what was going on, the bear was in manacles, led away by the guard. 
As they walked, Yaya's eyes fell upon the badge adorning the man's uniform, proudly proclaiming allegiance to LTR. He recalled the stories he had heard about the organization's ruthless tactics and unjust arrests, its commander being the one and only Time Smith. Yaya threw himself back onto the guard, then grasped at the chance to escape from his manacles. 
It did not take long for the handcuffs to snap. His hand instinctively went for his pike, his trusty weapon that had aided him in almost every battle, and brought it down on the guard, who cried out in pain.
Though Yaya despised violence, he knew that in this world of treachery and betrayal, sometimes it was necessary to fight for one's freedom. As he stood over his fallen adversary, he vowed to continue the struggle against tyranny, no matter the cost.
Even policemen turned to bitter hatred and mind-numbing evil, and they joined a notorious and massive organisation called LTR. It was dedicated to massacring people in big numbers and gaining control of everyone’s homes, just like Big Brother did way back then, in 1984. After that, the organisation would take full control of everyone’s minds. What next?
“Yaya,” a voice said behind him. “What are you doing here?”
Yaya turned around, expecting to see Time Smith, but the voice was oddly familiar, in a good way. Aegis Wick, his former master, stood there, wielding his golden sceptre of enlightenment. Master Wick was a frizzy haired man who had mastered inner energy, having granted the power of the Golden Purity. In fact, his martial arts and fighting capabilities had reached to an extent in which even though he was at the crippling age of 74, he could fight the world’s strongest man and even win. 
Aegis Wick had taught Yaya his entire life as Yaya honed his skills in combat prowess. 
“Ahh! Old master! We meet again,” Yaya whooped, but his joy was ephemeral. A group of guards had followed them into the dilapidated hut they were situated in, and they were cornered. 
“Get ready, Yaya. Remember what we talked about. Always be careful. Come on, this will be a breeze,” Aegis Wick said as he raised his sceptre. 
“Got it. Let’s show ‘em.” Yaya raised his pike. The air crackled with tension as each blow landed, the air laced thick with the blood of battle.
Despite their best efforts, the guards pressed on relentlessly, their numbers overwhelming. Yaya gritted his teeth in frustration, his heart pounding with the weight of the battle. He glanced over at Aegis Wick, his mentor and friend, his eyes reflecting a silent plea for strength and guidance.
Aegis held his ground, duelling three soldiers at once, drawn equal to them, pushing them back using ancient mojos in the form of a celestial forcefield. Yaya was duelling another soldier nearby, his eyes locked in the battle with furious concentration. The soldier completely knew what he was doing, and Yaya struggled to defend against the soldier’s quick reflexes.
 And then, in the blink of an eye, it happened.
Aegis Wick stumbled backwards, a look of shock and pain etched onto his face as a blade pierced his chest. Time seemed to stand still as Yaya watched in horror, his mind unable to process the sight before him.
"No..." Yaya's voice cracked with emotion as he rushed to Aegis Wick's side, his hands trembling as he attempted to staunch the flow of blood. "You can't leave me, master. Not like this."
But Aegis Wick's strength was fading fast, his breaths coming in ragged gasps as he clung to the threads of his dear life. He reached out a trembling hand, grasping Yaya's arm feebly. 
"Yaya," he whispered as rivers of blood poured out of him. "You must carry on. The fight...is not over."
Tears welled in Yaya's eyes as he listened to Aegis Wick's final words, his heart breaking at the thought of losing his mentor. But even as grief threatened to consume him, he knew that he had to honour Aegis Wick's sacrifice and continue the fight. He was shocked as time seemed to stand still. He felt his body be tugged somewhere else. The last thing he felt was his body falling before it all went black… He awoke to the sound of battle with weapons clashing. He cautiously opened his eyes to gaze upon himself and Aegis Wick… duelling? He realised that he was on a grassy plain as the radiance of the scintillating sun shone upon him, emanating its warmth, but oddly he felt no sunlight on him. Utterly confused, he stood up and noticed something even stranger; he had no shadow. Knowing something was not right he ran over to the pair of duelists asking them what was this and where they were. However they seemed to not hear him so he asked again, still no response. He saw himself duelling Aegis Wick, who had gained the upper hand, knocked him to the ground and put a sword to his neck. The bear began to sob, “I can’t do this.” 
“Yaya,” said Aegis Wick. “Even if you are beaten, never give up. Even if all your allies are killed, never falter. Remember the reason you’re fighting. So hold that hope in your heart and never let go. That is the true key to victory.” 
With that, Yaya felt himself being forcefully twisted and pulled back into reality, unwilling to return back to the dire and melancholy present. It took him a moment to return to his senses and figure out that he was standing over Aegis Wick’s dying body.
With a heavy heart, Yaya watched as the light faded from Aegis Wick's eyes, his mentor's final breath escaping into the cold night air. And as the sounds of battle raged on around him, Yaya vowed to carry on Aegis Wick's legacy, to fight with all his strength and courage until justice was served.
