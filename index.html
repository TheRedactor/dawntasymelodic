    <p>Yaya stood at the edge of Unknown Town, a sense of foreboding washing over him as he gazed upon the desolate town before him. Unknown Town was further than Yaya had ever ventured. The moon cast an eerie glow over the abandoned streets and at once Yaya regretted coming on this mission; he wished he had just stayed home.</p>

    <p>He had once dwelled in Bear Village, a Utopia that he would never forget. He had been one of the village’s most honourable warriors, but ever since the delinquents had come to Bear Village, plundered everything and took everyone he loved, he knew that he had to fight not just for the legacy of Bear Village, but also for the world. But that was when his epic journey commenced. After he had been banished out of town by the Bear Chief for ‘letting them down’, he had encountered numerous perils which had extended his combat capabilities to a grade in which he was selected into the Time Rebellion League, a group of fearless rebels devoted to taking down the evils of the world, abolishing totalitarian rule and liberate the land of Isllandio off the clutches of the notorious tyrant known as Time Smith. Only a few months ago did Time Smith place his draconian laws in place, and it didn’t take long for a single brave mutineer known as Blokk to hold a rebellion against him. Blokk had called it the “Time Rebellion League”, “TRL” for short. He had set up their ‘secret hideout’ on a small sequestered outpost they called Sepdet Outpost, a few miles from Unknown Town. Blokk knew that just himself wasn’t enough to liberate Isllandio. He needed an army of people who all fought for the same obligation. And so Yaya joined with the hope of achieving redemption within his Bear community and being recognised as a saviour to Isllandio. Yaya also knew of Captain Salvapige, a legendary hero who had died before his grandmother’s eyes, who had written a recount and died seconds after. He had died for his own city, Doenoughts. For a split second Yaya felt like Salvapige, who had always been a menace to ruffians. But the thought of Time Smith made him step back once more. He had gained a reputation of never failing a task, but this was different. This was Time Smith he was facing. He felt a knot of apprehension tightening in his chest as he contemplated the mission that lay ahead. It proved to be a daunting challenge, but Yaya knew that the fate of his people depended on his success. He had been given a chance to prove his worth, and this was it. He couldn’t give up right now.</p>

    <p>With a deep breath, Yaya pushed aside his doubts and stepped forward into the darkness. As he ventured deeper into Unknown Town, Yaya picked up the odour of corpses; this was a place where safety was not guaranteed, at all. Around him, dilapidated buildings crumbled and the reflections were a menace. The once vibrant city had been reduced to a ghostly shell of its former self, a testament to the cruelty of Time Smith's rule. Time Smith had taken everything from him, and though he had never caught a glimpse of this notorious tyrant, he knew that everything, EVERYTHING was Time Smith’s fault. With renewed determination, Yaya trudged on, his heart set ablaze with the fire of justice.</p>

    <p>"Stop right there!" A voice shattered the silence, slicing through Yaya's thoughts like a blade. He turned slowly, paralyzed by fear, to face the source of the command. Before him stood a figure cloaked in army attire, bearing the scars of countless battles etched into his weathered face. His muscles bulged beneath the fabric, and his eyes gleamed with a warlike intensity that made Yaya's spine quake with anxiety. In his hand, he held a sharp spear, its tip aimed directly at Yaya's heart. "What... what are you doing?" Yaya's voice trembled as he struggled to form the words. "Putting you under arrest," the man growled, snarling menacingly. "But I'm allergic to manacles," Yaya blurted out, his mind racing to find a way out of the predicament. "Are you?" The man's tone was dismissive as he raised his spear until it was touching Yaya’s throat. Yaya felt the manacles tighten. "Yes. Last time I was near them, I almost got anaphylaxis. Take it off please," Yaya insisted, grasping at any excuse to evade capture. Despite Yaya's protestations, the man moved forward, his grip tightening on the spear. With one swift stroke, he leapt at Yaya and before Yaya figured out what was going on, the bear was in manacles, led away by the guard. As they walked, Yaya's eyes fell upon the badge adorning the man's uniform, proudly proclaiming allegiance to LTR. He recalled the stories he had heard about the organization's ruthless tactics and unjust arrests, its commander being the one and only Time Smith. Yaya threw himself back onto the guard, then grasped at the chance to escape from his manacles. It did not take long for the handcuffs to snap. His hand instinctively went for his pike, his trusty weapon that had aided him in almost every battle, and brought it down on the guard, who cried out in pain. Though Yaya despised violence, he knew that in this world of treachery and betrayal, sometimes it was necessary to fight for one's freedom. As he stood over his fallen adversary, he vowed to continue the struggle against tyranny, no matter the cost. Even policemen turned to bitter hatred and mind-numbing evil, and they joined a notorious and massive organisation called LTR. It was dedicated to massacring people in big numbers and gaining control of everyone’s homes, just like Big Brother did
